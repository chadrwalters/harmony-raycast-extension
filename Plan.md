# Harmony Raycast Extension Refactoring Plan

## Overview
Based on the senior developer code review, we need to improve several areas of the codebase to align with Raycast extension best practices and enhance maintainability. This document outlines specific issues, solutions, and implementation strategy.

## Current Issues and Solutions

### Component Structure
**Issues:**
- `HarmonyCommand.tsx` is handling too much responsibility ✅
- View logic is mixed with state management ✅
- Duplicate error handling patterns ✅

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ Break down `HarmonyCommand.tsx` into focused view components
2. ✅ Use simple view state management
3. ✅ Create reusable shared components

### State Management
**Issues:**
- Complex state updates in useHarmony ✅
- Scattered preference management ✅
- Redundant state derivations ✅

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ Implement Zustand store for centralized state
2. ✅ Move async operations to store actions
3. ✅ Use selectors for derived state

### Error Handling
**Issues:**
- Inconsistent error handling ✅
- Duplicate try/catch blocks ✅
- Basic error messages ✅

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ Implement simple, centralized error handling
2. ✅ Use Raycast's toast system effectively
3. ✅ Add proper error recovery flows

### Performance
**Issues:**
- Unnecessary re-renders ✅
- Inefficient data fetching ✅
- Memory leaks ✅

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ Implement proper cleanup in useEffect
2. ✅ Use memoization for expensive computations
3. ✅ Proper component unmounting

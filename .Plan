## Phase 1: Code Organization and Structure
Status: Complete

### File Structure
- [x] Task 1.1: Organize commands into dedicated directory
  - Move command files to `src/` root directory per Raycast requirements
  - Update import paths to reflect new file locations

### Component Organization

  - Create `src/core/` directory
  - Move and organize into subdirectories:
    - `src/core/harmony/` for harmony-specific code
      - Move `harmony.ts`, `harmonyClient.ts`, `harmonyMachine.ts`
    - `src/core/storage/`
      - Move `secureStorage.ts` -> `secure-storage.ts`
    - `src/core/network/`
      - Move `networkRetry.ts` -> `network-retry.ts`
    - `src/core/session/`
      - Move `sessionManager.ts` -> `session-manager.ts`
    - `src/core/utils/`
      - Move `validator.ts`, `performance.ts`
    - `src/core/logging/`
      - Move `logger.ts`, `errorHandler.ts`
    - `src/core/ui/`
      - Move `toastManager.ts` -> `toast-manager.ts`

### Types and Hooks
- [x] Task 1.4: Organize types and hooks
  - Create feature-specific type directories
    - Move `harmony.ts` to `src/features/control/types/`
    - Move `error.ts` to `src/core/types/`
  - Create feature-specific hook directories
    - Move `useHarmony.ts` to `src/features/control/hooks/`

### Documentation
- [x] Task 1.5: Update documentation
  - Add README.md with directory structure explanation
  - Add comments to clarify file purposes
  - Update import paths in all files

## Phase 2: Code Style and Conventions
Status: Complete

- [x] Task 2.1: Establish naming conventions
  - Use PascalCase for components
  - Use camelCase for functions and variables
  - Use kebab-case for utility files
  - Use consistent file extensions (.tsx for components, .ts for utilities)

- [x] Task 2.2: Code organization within files
  - Order imports consistently:
    - External dependencies first
    - Types second
    - Core services third
    - Components last
  - Group related functions and types
  - Add section comments for clarity
  - Add JSDoc comments for classes and methods

## Phase 3: Bug Fixes and Improvements
Status: In Progress

- [x] Task 3.1: Fix React component issues
  - Update React imports in settings.tsx
  - Fix useCallback and useState usage
  - Add proper type definitions

- [x] Task 3.2: Fix storage service
  - Convert SecureStorage to use instance methods
  - Add proper encryption/decryption
  - Fix get/set method implementations

- [x] Task 3.3: Fix hub discovery
  - Implement proper port handling
  - Add discovery timeout
  - Improve error handling and cleanup
  - Use dynamic port range (62000-62010)

- [ ] Task 3.4: Test core functionality
  - Verify hub connection
  - Test device control
  - Validate settings management
